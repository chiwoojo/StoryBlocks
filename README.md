A web application that lets you create a story with your friends through real-time collaboration. This is a project that worked on at Hack Reactor. We took 3 days to come up with an idea and finish an MVP project. 

This project is built on Node.js, Express, Socket.io, and jQuery with MaterializeCSS for styling.
